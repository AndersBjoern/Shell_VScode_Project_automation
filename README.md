# project-creation-automation

Automate the process of creating a new project and adding it to GitHub with a single command.
The command creates a new directory on your machine, initializes a Github repo with a README and pushes it to the configured Github account.
It then navigates to the newly created directory and runs `code .` to open your project folder in VS Code.
